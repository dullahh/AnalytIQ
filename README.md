# AnalytIQ
Inspired from the project I did in the HackSheffield Hackathon

Improved version of AnalytIQ:
Uses QP and Markowitz theory for optimisation rather than just LP
Uses Alpha Vantage API to gather real time stock data rather than manually inserting it
Uses other data tools like Numpy and Pandas etc to do additional statistical calculations for optimisation
